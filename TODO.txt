1. Fix IFJCode24 instructions (need to specify a data type when using a literal, for example int@100)

2. Assigning function returns to variables: For example const a : i32 = sum(10, 20, 30);
- The same for reassigning to variables, maybe use VariableAssignment for both?
- Do the same for embedded functions: var a : ?u8[] = ifj.readstr(); // I think the function is called readstr

3. Conditionals: Generate code for expr in if(expr) and labels for if/else/end (else/end are probably enough)
- Jump to else if the else condition is true
- Else perform the if cond and then jump to end (label after the else part)
- Type checking in the if expression
- if(expr) |expr_result| - type checking, create a new variable in the symtable for expr_result, etc.

4. Loops: Generate code for the boolean expr in while(expr)
- Generate a label for while
- 2 options, jump to while, then evaluate and if false jump to end?
- Other option is to evaluate at the end, but that works like a do-while loop


4. Calling embedded functions: Has to be done using the equivalent IFJCode24 instructions

5. Write instruction: how do %d and %a actually work?

6. Symtable: Rework the symtable to use open adressing instead of linked lists (I hate this) --> Maybe do nod need to do this?
