1. Variable was used check - has to be used in a expression AND has to be assigned to
2. Pseudo variable _ usage
3. When generating variables at the start of a function, include variables defined in nullable conditionals
    - So if(var) |VAR|{...} DEFVAR LF@VAR should be at the start of the function
    - Same goes for while(bar) |BAR| {...} DEFVAR LF@BAR should be at the start of the function
4. Test driven development
